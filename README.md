### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Differences in Speeches during War-time and Peace-time
+ This project is conducted by Xinhu Wang

+ Project summary: This project is aiming on analyze the U.S. presidents' inauguration speeches. Among the total 58 inauguration speeches, some of them were made during war time, such as Civil War, World War, and Cold War, while others were made during peace time, or no-war time. In the speeches, presidents usually talk about their plans for the next four years and also express their hope and emotion based on the nation's current situation. In this project, I selected part of the speeches and looked for some major differences of speeches made during war time and other time, by doing text mining, emotion analysis and visualizations. What kind of emotions are commonly used in inauguration speeches in different situation? Fear of Joy? What are the presidents' most concern mentioned from their speeches? Freedom or Economics?

I picked ten speeches during war time, including Civil War, WWI, WWII, Cold War, and Iraq War. They are:

AbrahamLincoln-1 --- Civil War

AbrahamLincoln-2 --- Civil War

Woodrowwilson-1 --- World War I

Woodrowwilson-2 --- World War I
